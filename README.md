# Quadrumvirate of Fate: The Living Beyond

</n>

## **STATUS:** *Release Date: TBD* *Coming Soon!*

</n>

> Quadrumvirate of Fate: The Living Beyond is a Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Persistent World that will be available under the PW Action Category.
>
> We're currently in beta and not open to the public, yet...
> This github, the attached website, and the module itself are all still a work in progress (WIP).
>
>
> Update: Currently there is only one person scripting the base systems and doing the 2DA work in my free time and due to the amount of things Id like to add and the work required to do so- it is taking considerably longer than I first expected. Development Plans have shifted a bit as a result. At some point I will get around to updating the wiki as its currently a mess and not accurate in the slightest. - ∆ùùî¶ùî§ùî•ùî±∆¶ùîûùò∑ùî¢…≥

- ## **NWSync** is *Enabled*

  - **NOTE:** A large first time download is required to play here due to the custom content \ resources we are using. It's roughly a quarter of the size if you already have the CEP nwsyncd.
